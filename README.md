| `sensor.epson_printer_black_ink` | Black Ink | % | Black ink level |
| `sensor.epson_printer_magenta_ink` | Magenta Ink | % | Magenta ink level |
| `sensor.epson_printer_cyan_ink` | Cyan Ink | % | Cyan ink level |
| `sensor.epson_printer_yellow_ink` | Yellow Ink | % | Yellow ink level |
| `sensor.epson_printer_cleaning_cartridge` | Cleaning Cartridge | % | Cleaning cartridge level |

## Usage

### Basic Lovelace Card

```yaml
type: entities
title: Epson Printer - Ink Levels
entities:
  - entity: sensor.epson_printer_black_ink
    name: Black
  - entity: sensor.epson_printer_magenta_ink  
    name: Magenta
  - entity: sensor.epson_printer_cyan_ink
    name: Cyan
  - entity: sensor.epson_printer_yellow_ink
    name: Yellow
  - entity: sensor.epson_printer_cleaning_cartridge
    name: Cleaning Cartridge
```

### Gauge Cards

```yaml
type: gauge
entity: sensor.epson_printer_black_ink
name: Black Ink
min: 0
max: 100
severity:
  green: 50
  yellow: 25
  red: 0
```

### Low Ink Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Low ink level notification"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: 
          - sensor.epson_printer_black_ink
          - sensor.epson_printer_magenta_ink
          - sensor.epson_printer_cyan_ink
          - sensor.epson_printer_yellow_ink
        below: 10
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Low ink level"
          message: "{{ trigger.to_state.name }} is {{ trigger.to_state.state }}%"
```

## Testing

Use the included test script to verify printer connectivity before setup:

```bash
python test_printer.py 192.168.0.5
```

This will test the connection and display current ink levels.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot connect to printer**
   - Verify the printer IP address is correct
   - Ensure the printer is powered on and connected to network
   - Check firewall settings
   - Test connectivity using the test script

2. **Sensors show "unavailable"**
   - Check Home Assistant logs for errors
   - Verify `epsonprinter` package is installed
   - Ensure printer model supports ink level reporting

3. **Some sensors missing**
   - Not all printer models support all ink types
   - Cleaning cartridge may not be available on all models
   - Check printer specifications

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.epson_printer: debug
```
